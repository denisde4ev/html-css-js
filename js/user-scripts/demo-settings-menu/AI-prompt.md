Here's a complex userscript that accomplishes your request using `GM_registerMenuCommand`, `GM_getValue`, and `GM_setValue`. It dynamically updates the menu items when the user changes the settings.

{{./ChatGPT-code.js}}

### Features:
- Initializes five settings with default values (1 to 5).
- Saves user inputs persistently using `GM_setValue`.
- Updates `GM_registerMenuCommand` dynamically when a setting changes.
- Unregisters old menu items before adding new ones to prevent duplicates.

Let me know if you need modifications! ðŸš€

Here's a complex userscript that creates a menu with five settings. Each setting can be adjusted by the user through a prompt, and the settings are saved using `GM_setValue`. If there are no saved settings, default values will be used. The script also updates the menu commands to reflect the current settings:

```javascript
{{./Copilot-code.js}}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The script initializes the settings either with saved values from `GM_getValue` or with default values (1 to 5).

2. **Updating Settings**:
   - The `updateSetting` function shows a prompt to the user to update a specific setting. If the input is valid, it updates the setting and saves the new value using `GM_setValue`. It then refreshes the menu commands.

3. **Refreshing Menu Commands**:
   - The `refreshMenuCommands` function unregisters old menu commands (if `GM_unregisterMenuCommand` is supported) and registers new commands with the updated settings.

4. **Initial Registration**:
   - The script calls `refreshMenuCommands` at the end to register the initial menu commands.

This example assumes that `GM_unregisterMenuCommand` is available, which may not be the case in all environments. If it's not supported, you can omit the unregistering part and focus on registering new commands. If you need any adjustments or further examples, just let me know!

I'll help you create a UserScript menu system with 5 settings that persist using GM storage.



```javascript
{{Cladue-code.js}}

```

This script creates a complete menu system with 5 settings that:

1. Initializes with default values (1-5) if no settings exist
2. Creates menu items showing current values
3. Prompts for new values when clicked
4. Validates input (must be 1-10)
5. Saves settings using GM_setValue
6. Updates menu items to show new values
7. Properly unregisters old menu items before creating new ones

To use this script:

1. Install it in your UserScript manager (like Tampermonkey)
2. You'll see 5 menu items in your UserScript menu
3. Click any setting to change its value
4. Values persist between page reloads
5. Invalid inputs are rejected with an alert

Would you like me to modify anything about how the settings work or add any additional features?
