Yes! If you’re trying to identify a Unicode character just by its shape,
**[Shapecatcher](https://shapecatcher.com)** is exactly what you need.

🖌️ **How it works:**
- You draw the character in a simple box using your mouse or touchscreen.
- Click “Recognize,” and it will match your drawing to the closest Unicode glyphs.
- It currently supports over 11,000 characters (though not Chinese, Japanese, or Korean yet).

It’s surprisingly effective for symbols, math characters, and obscure glyphs you might stumble across but don’t know how to type.

If you're looking for something more text-based or want to explore Unicode blocks,
[Unicode Character Finder](https://www.mclean.net.nz/ucf/) is another great tool—but it doesn’t support drawing.

Want to test it out with a specific symbol or character you’ve seen? I can help guide you through it.
